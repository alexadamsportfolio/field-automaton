Though the-math-behind-it.md delineates the mathematics most necessary to the behavior of this project, it would be a shame for a STEM portfolio not to have some mention of my less successful findings - after all, the end is the smallest, and arguably the most trivial, stage in mathematics.
This is a gallery of the surviving minority of my incomplete, if not incorrect, attempts on the field-automaton project; but they are no less interesting.

Let's begin with the first written form of the fundamental equation which describes a massive range of cellular automata - including John Conway's Game of Life and my continuous analogy for it - as is found in the-math-behind-it.md [I]:

I unwittingly stuck out my tongue, as it was really awkward trying to hold a flimsy notebook that close to the camera on a chromebook, and I thought that the notebook would conceal my face.

Moving on, having an excess of free time in my classes - in this case AP Macroeconomics - I often pursue my mathematical curiosities on the paper of my assignments. 
Though I have neglected my research into field-automaton/life.py in favor of single-body-automaton/fish.py, a simpler case, below is my deepest inquisition into the mathematics of the former:

PLACEHOLDER PARAGRAPH

I would like to conclude this gallery with an image of me at the Texas State Capitol with fish.py and life.py, where I would present my programs to the 89th Texas Legislature for the CS4TX Code @ The Capitol Event.
